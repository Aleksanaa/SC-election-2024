- Make sure people know the reason why somebody didn't become a candidate
- Maybe no need to use different repos for every election, can just create separate branches
  - This way we also kind of have a canonical source for voter ids, people don't need to update it every year!
  - Although, we need to regenerate the voters.json _without_ overriding older entries then
  - Could set the default branch name to the current year
- Make a video explaining the voting process
