          Hello, @@GITHUB_LOGIN@

        ''
        + ''
          As a first step towards a better governance for official Nix projects,
          we are happy to announce the kick-off of the [first Nix Steering Committee election][repo]!

          [repo]: ${repo}

          The Steering Committee will be a primary leadership body, responsible for steering the official Nix projects;
          organisationally, socially and technically.
          This includes making decisions over what is official, managing teams,
          approving NixOS Foundation policies relevant for the community,
          being the final escalation point, and more.

          While the SC is given the authority to make decisions within the scope of its responsibilities directly,
          one of the primary goals should be to delegate as much of it as possible.
