# How to cast a vote

Prerequisites to be able to vote:
- To be an [eligible voter](../README.md#eligible-voters).
  If you are not, you can [request an exception](./exception-request.md).
- To have a valid email address listed in [`voters.json`](../voters.json).
  If that's not the case, make sure to [update it](./email.md).

Be aware of the [the timeline](../README.md#timeline): The deadline for updating emails addresses is Sunday 2024-10-06.

## Email activation

To be able to vote, you also need to activate your email address on the voting platform:
1. Go to the [CIVS Activate User page](https://civs1.civs.us/cgi-bin/opt_in.pl)
2. Follow the steps using your email address in `voters.json`

## Casting a vote

If you activated your email, you'll get an email from CIVS once the poll starts, otherwise you'll get a reminder to activate it from the EC.

If the voting period already started, on the email activation page you will see the link under "Pending poll invitations". If you missed this, go through the email activation again.

To cast a vote, follow the steps on the voting page.

TODO: Insert pictures or so

Please don't give your receipt away to others, this allows them to vote for you, without you being able to override their vote again.

The deadline for voting is Sunday 2024-10-20.

## Email deactivation

We don't recommend deactivating your email,
as it's likely that CIVS will also be used for future elections,
but you can do so anyways on the [CIVS Mail Management page](https://civs1.civs.us/cgi-bin/mail_mgmt.pl),
note the warning.
