# How to cast a vote

Prerequisites to be able to vote:
- To be an [eligible voter](../README.md#eligible-voters).
  If you are not, you can [request an exception](./exception-request.md).
- To have a valid Email address listed in [`voters.json`](../voters.json).
  If that's not the case, make sure to [update it](./email.md).

Make sure to check the above [before the election lock-in](../README.md#lock-in) on Monday 2024-10-07.

## Email registration

To actually vote, you also need to register the same Email address as in `voters.json` with [CIVS](https://civs1.civs.us/)
by going to the [CIVS Activate User page](https://civs1.civs.us/cgi-bin/opt_in.pl) and following the steps:
1. Enter your email and click "Request Activation Code"
1. Go to your inbox, you should've received an email from <civs@cornell.edu>, copy the code
1. Insert it into the page and click "Complete activation"


Note that we don't recommend unregistering your email,
as it's likely that CIVS will also be used for future elections.
You can do so anyways on the [CIVS Mail Management page](https://civs1.civs.us/cgi-bin/mail_mgmt.pl),
but note the warning.

## Casting a vote

If you registered your email, you'll get an email from CIVS once the poll starts, otherwise you'll get a reminder to activate it from the EC.

If the voting period already started, on the registration page you will see the link under "Pending poll invitations"

To cast a vote, follow the steps on the voting page.

TODO: Insert pictures or so

Please don't give your receipt away to others, this allows them to vote for you, without you being able to override their vote again.
