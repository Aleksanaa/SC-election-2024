# How to request a voter exception

People who have contributed roughly the equivalent of 25 commits within the [specified time period](../README.md#eligible-voters),
but whose contributions aren't accurately [counted automatically](../README.md#automatically-eligible-voters),
have the option of requesting an exception.

Other than GitHub contributions, the EC will also consider contributions such as:
- Participation in official teams
- Infrastructure maintenance
- Organisation of official events
- Maintenance of official third-party accounts (e.g. social media)
- etc.

As detailed on [the timeline](../README.md#timeline), the deadline for requesting voter exceptions is Sunday 2024-10-06.
Requests are valid as long as they get received while it is still that day [anywhere on earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth).
Any requests that come in too late will be rejected.

To request an exception:

1. Send an email to <elections@nixos.org> containing:
   - Links to your contributions within the [specified time period](../README.md#eligible-voters).
   - Include your GitHub handle if you'd also like to get access to interact with this repository
     to [endorse nominees](./endorse.md) or [ask questions](./qna.md)
1. You may [register your email](./vote.md#email-registration) in advance in case you get accepted.
1. We might request more info from you, but eventually you will receive a reply stating whether you've been accepted.
1. If you've been accepted:
   - Check that your email and optionally GitHub id has been added to [the voter list](../voters.json).
   - Make sure to [register your email](./vote.md#email-registration).
