# Candidate Q&A

To inform voters about the candidates, there is an opportunity to ask questions to the candidates/nominees.

Once the deadline is over, the answers (or absence thereof) will be compiled into the candidates file, which will be linked on the ballot.

## If you want to ask a question

As an [eligible voters](../README.md#eligible-voters), even as a candidate/nominee,
you can ask questions to (other) candidates/nominees.
Questions may be directed to specific candidates/nominees.
But note that even candidates/nominees you didn't ask can answer your question.

Please keep questions short and relevant.

Be aware of the [the timeline](../README.md#timeline): The deadline for asking questions is Thursday 2024-10-03.

### How to ask a question

1. Look through [existing questions](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aquestion) to make sure nobody else asked your question already.

   If your question has been asked before, but you'd like to ask a specific candidate/nominee to answer it,
   and they haven't been @-mentioned already, you can @-mention them.

2. [Create a new GitHub issue using the candidate question issue template](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/new?template=candidate-question.yml) and fill it out accordingly.

### Rules
- Keep questions respectful and civil
- Do not comment on questions unless you are a candidate/nominee
  - The one exception is that if you want to ask additional candidates/nominees explicitly,
    and they haven't been @-mentioned yet, then you can @-mention them.
  - If you have follow-up questions, you can create another issue
- Do not edit your question, other than minor fixes such as typos

If you violate these rules, the EC reserves the right to remove violating content and revoke access to this repository.

## If you are a candidate/nominee and want to answer questions

As a candidate or even nominee, you might be requested by voters to answer specific questions with an @-mention,
but you can also answer questions that you haven't been asked directly.
Note that you don't need to answer every question.

Please keep answers short and relevant.
Note that editing answers is allowed.

Be aware of the [the timeline](../README.md#timeline): The deadline for asking questions is Sunday 2024-10-06.
